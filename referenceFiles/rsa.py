This Python package provides an implementation of the RSA encryption algorithm
intended to introduce it and explain its operation.   Its intent is to
show the use of Python as a notation for simplifying the description of
the algorithms used in the current computer networking.

This Python package provides an implementation of RSA in Python. 

Implementation Architecture

The RSA package has the following modules and class hierarchy.

   * module: primetools
   
            class Primetools:

               A collection of methods for working with primes
               Provides an iterator that yields primes in order
               Its primary goal is to be both easily understood
               and relatively efficient.



    * module: modulararithmetic

        class Modular_Arithmetic(Euler):

            Implements modular arithmetic for a given modulus.

                Modular_Arithmetic It implements the following Modular Arithmetic Operations:
                
                a+b  a-b  a*b  a//b  a**b    -b  ~b   repr str int

            def modular(modulus):  
            
                A plain class factory for the Modular_Arithmetic class
                Separates specification of a modulus for modular arithmetic
                operations other modular arithmetic functions. See examples.

The RSA_public class is provided with the RSA public key (pq,e) when it is

pq is the product of p and q.
e is the exponent

The RSA_public key class is not provided with the primes p and q.  The
RSA_private class is provided with p and q.  This is the only difference
between the two methods.
The RSA public key class does not have the factorization of the modulus pq into two primes.
Consequently, the RSA_public class does cannot calculate the totient
of p or that of q, and therefore does not know the totient of pq.

The RSA private key does have p and q and can therefor calculate the totient of pq.

The fundamental question of whether RSA encryption can be broken is this:
long would it take an attacker to factor pq into p and q, create to totient
of pq and therefore be able to calculate the decryption key d,
the multiplicative inverse of (e mod pq).

The answer to "how long it would take an attacker to factor pq" is therefore
the entire basis for RSA encryption.
